## Resource description
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Message is started in the event channel for both incoming and outgoing scenarios. For outgoing instant messages, the message delivery status can be tracked via the event channel. When the message is part of a peer-to-peer conversation, the delivery status merely indicates whether the message was delivered to the remote participant. In the multi-party case, the delivery status indicates which of the remote participants failed to receive the message. For incoming instant messages, message captures information such as the remote participant who sent the message, the time stamp, and the body of the message. If an incoming instant message is received by UCWA but is not fetched by the application via the event channel in a timely fashion (within 30 seconds), the message will time out and the app will not be able to receive it. Additionally, the sender of the message will be notified that the message was not received.
